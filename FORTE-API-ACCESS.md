# 🔑 How to Get FORTE.io API Access

## 🎯 **FORTE.io vs Forte Payment Systems**

**IMPORTANT**: There are **two different companies** named "Forte":

1. **FORTE.io** 🎮 - Blockchain compliance platform (what dmulvi/rwa-demo uses)
2. **Forte Payment Systems** 💳 - Traditional payment processor (different company)

Your project needs **FORTE.io** (the blockchain compliance platform).

## 📋 **Steps to Get FORTE.io API Access**

### **Step 1: Visit FORTE.io Developer Portal**
🔗 **URL**: https://forte.mintlify.app/
📍 **Main Site**: https://www.forte.io/developers/

### **Step 2: Access the Rules Engine**
- FORTE Rules Engine is **free and open-source**
- Compatible with Ethereum, Polygon, Base, and other EVM chains
- No traditional "API key" - it's a smart contract-based system

### **Step 3: Get Started with Integration**
```bash
# The FORTE Rules Engine is deployed via smart contracts
# You don't need a traditional API key like REST APIs
```

## 🔍 **How dmulvi/rwa-demo Actually Works**

Based on the repository analysis, **dmulvi/rwa-demo doesn't use a traditional cloud API**. Instead:

### **FORTE Rules Engine Architecture**:
1. **Smart Contract Integration** - Rules are deployed as on-chain contracts
2. **SDK Injection** - Rules are injected into your smart contracts
3. **Local Policy Management** - Policies are JSON files applied to contracts

### **Real Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
// From dmulvi/rwa-demo
npx tsx sdk.ts injectModifiers policies/ofac-deny-erc721.json src/Contract.sol
npx tsx sdk.ts setupPolicy policies/kyc-level.json
npx tsx sdk.ts applyPolicy $POLICY_ID $CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

## 🏗️ **What This Means for Your Project**

### **Current Status**:
- ✅ Your **14 FORTE rules** are correctly implemented
- ✅ Your **policy structure** matches FORTE.io format
- ✅ Your **SDK pattern** follows dmulvi/rwa-demo approach
- ❌ **Missing**: Smart contract modifier injection

### **What You Need to Add**:

1. **Smart Contract Modifiers**:
   ```solidity
   // Add FORTE rule modifiers to your contracts
   modifier forteCompliance(bytes calldata data) {
       require(checkRules(data), "FORTE compliance failed");
       _;
   }
   ```

2. **Contract Deployment Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Inject FORTE modifiers into your contracts
   npx tsx sdk.ts injectModifiers policies/institutional-rwa-complete.json src/InstitutionalAsset.sol
   ```

3. **On-Chain Policy Application**:
   ```typescript
   // Apply policies to deployed contracts
   const policyId = await sdk.setupPolicy('policies/institutional-rwa-complete.json');
   await sdk.applyPolicy(policyId, contractAddress);
   ```

## 🚀 **Updated Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: No API Key Needed** ✅
Your current implementation is already sophisticated and follows FORTE patterns.

### **Phase 2: Smart Contract Integration** 
```bash
# Add FORTE modifiers to your contracts
npm run inject-modifiers
npm run deploy-with-forte
```

### **Phase 3: On-Chain Policy Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy policies on-chain
npm run setup-policy
npm run apply-policy
```

## 💡 **Key Insight**

**FORTE.io doesn't use traditional API keys** - it's a **smart contract-based compliance system**. The "API" is actually:
- Smart contract modifiers
- On-chain policy contracts  
- JSON policy configurations
- SDK for policy management

## 🎯 **Your Project Status**

You **already have** a more sophisticated implementation than dmulvi/rwa-demo:
- ✅ **14 rules** vs their 3 rules
- ✅ **Institutional focus** vs art fractionalization  
- ✅ **PYUSD integration** vs basic tokens
- ✅ **Multi-chain deployment** vs single chain
- ✅ **ZK PRET integration** (advanced)

You just need to **add the smart contract modifier injection** to complete the FORTE.io integration!

## 📞 **If You Need Direct Support**

- **FORTE.io Discord**: Join their developer community
- **GitHub**: Check FORTE.io repositories for examples
- **Documentation**: https://forte.mintlify.app/

**Bottom Line**: You don't need to "sign up" for an API key - FORTE.io is an open-source smart contract system that you integrate directly into your contracts! 🎉
